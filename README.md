# Paradise Island (3D Scene)

This is the final project for a computer graphics class. It shows an inland with moving clouds and water texture.
The user can set the sun's azimuth, changing its position and its color. When a user clicks on a cloud, he/she can change its height. To rotate the island, the user can press J or L.
The island and the clouds are GLTF 3D models loaded in the scene. The sky and the water are textures availble on Three.js library. The scene is available online [here](https://lucasste.github.io/Paradise-Island/).
